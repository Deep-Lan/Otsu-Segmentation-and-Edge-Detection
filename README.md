# Otsu-Segmentation and Edge-Detection
Otsu-Segmentation algorithm and Edge-Detection algorithm

"实验报告" is the experiment report.It was written by Chinese.If you can't understand it,I'm sorry for that.
"cells.bmp" and "lena.bmp" are the experimental pictures.
"segmentation.py" and "edge.py" are python scripts."segmentation.py" is related to the Otsu-Thresholding-Segmentation algorithm and "edge.py" is related to the edge detector algorithm.The two scripts are independent,so you just need to run one at a time.

If you want to run the scripts,you need to use python3 to run them.The scripts need to import modules,which are "numpy","PIL" and "matplotlib"."segmentation.py" "edge.py" "cells.bmp" and "lena.bmp" must be set at the same subdirectory.Otherwise it would get back errors.
